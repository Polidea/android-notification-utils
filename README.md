mall utilities connected with notifications that Polidea (http://www.polidea.com/) is using in order to simplify handling notifications for android. 
They are inspired by iPhone notification system. 

The notifications are NOT aiming to replace android's broadcasts. 
They are mostly used in order to provide in-application notifications with typesafe notification arguments, 
simple registration and unregistration of listeners for particular types of notifications. 
The library contains also simple sensor and location handling classes that use the notification system. 
The two utils provide the nice features which are not there by default in android system, such as combining location retrieval 
from different providers and filtering orientation notification.
